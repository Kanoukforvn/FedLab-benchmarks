## Requirements

fedlab==1.2.1

## Run

We implement shifted and rotated data generation. And we accept the real-world data, e.g. femnist.

For shifted and rotated augmented data, we accept `mnist` and `cifar10` configuration now.
If you don't have the augmented data, you should set the config `process_data=1` to generate data firstly.

For real-world data, we refer [LEAF](https://github.com/TalwalkarLab/leaf) to simulate. In our benchmark, we implement in `fedlab_benchmarks/leaf/`. 
You can read the docs in `leaf` folder to generate data.

## Performance

Null
